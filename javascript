javascript is running on frontend and backend as well as in mobile phones 
but think about it ,how it is accessible??

so by default there is javaScript runtime environment present in frontend and backend which lets the program to execute without installing any packages

javascript runtime environment has consist of one very important thing
i.e,
(1)JavaScript(JS) Engine :-
chrome has JS engine called v8
mozilla firefox has spiderMonkey js engine

javaScript Engine is actually a program and consist of two thing 
        (1)call stack
        (2)Memory heap

        functions,arrays and objects they actually stored inside heap

        Initially, when we were creating variables and function then variables assigned the value undefined but function didn't ..
        it actually stored inside memory heap../ 


javascript runtime environment has javascript engines and web API's
webAPI's which gives access to javaScipt to the outside world ..for example:-alert(),confirm() etc.. are example of webAPI's, they are API's
which browser's provide...
different browser has different set of API's Some are common and some are changed
